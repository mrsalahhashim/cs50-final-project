<h2> About The Creator: </h2>
<p>My Name is, Salah El-Din Hashim, and i think i'm a web developer, i design and develop website, for example this site.</p>

<h2> About The Site: </h2>
<p> The Site is created by simple (Hyper Text Markup Language or -HTML- for short) and (Cascading Style Sheets or -CSS- for short).
The idea of this Website is to practice both (HTML & CSS). And learn the best way to achive such a thing. 
</p>
    
<h2> About Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):</h2>
<p>
Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process or making web pages presentable.
<br> CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, as well as a variety of other effects.
<p><font color="black"> <b>Advantages of CSS:</b> </font>
<br>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <font color="black"> <b>It saves time</b> </font>  - You can write css once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages as you want.
        </li>
        <li>
          <font color="black"> <b>Pages load faster</b></font>   - If you're using CSS, you dont need to write HTML tag attributes everytime. just write one CSS rule and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So, less code means faster download times. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <font color="black"> <b>Easy Maintenance</b></font>  - To make a global change, simply change the style, and all the elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.   
        </li>
        <li>
          <font color="black"> <b>Suprior style to HTML</b></font>   - CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML Page in comparison to HTML attributes. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <font color="black"> <b>Multiple Device Compatibility</b></font> - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cellphones or for printing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <font color="black"> <b>Global Web Standards</b></font> - Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers.
        </li>
    </ul>
